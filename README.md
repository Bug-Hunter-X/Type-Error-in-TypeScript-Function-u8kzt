This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript functions and how to solve it using type guards and type assertions. The `bug.ts` file contains a function `add` that is expected to receive two numbers and return their sum. However, calling `add` with a string and a number results in a type error because the function only accepts numbers as arguments. The `bugSolution.ts` file provides two solutions to fix this: a type guard and a type assertion.
